# SC0039 Exercise

## How to Run the Script

To run the `PN_assignment.py` script, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. **Download the Required Files**:
   - Ensure you have the `input.csv` file in the same directory as your script. This file is necessary for the script to run correctly. Note that, I have re-named this file as: `brca_cnvs_tcga-1-2.csv`
   - The `input.csv` file is included in the repository, so you don’t need to download it separately. Simply ensure it is present in the same directory as `PN_assignment.py`.

3. **Open Your Preferred Shell**:
   - I have used Visual Studio Code and my OS is Windows. You can run the script using any command line shell (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.), not just Visual Studio Code.

4. **Navigate to the Script Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your `PN_assignment.py` and `input.csv` files are located. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\directory
     ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script with the following command:
     ```bash
     python PN_assignment.py
     ```

## Important Notes

- **File Paths**: Ensure that the paths to the input files (like `input.csv`) are correctly set in the script. The paths may differ on your system, so adjust them as necessary.
- **Dependencies**: Check any dependencies required by the script, and install them using pip if necessary.
